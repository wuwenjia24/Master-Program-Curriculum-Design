You mastered the Tangam analytics and visualization software and independently constructed valuable customer-facing presentations. You used your superior data analytics skills to create recommendations on how clients can improve their operations.

You met with a couple of new clients in-person to assist with their data analytics needs and supported the rollout of Tangam's software. You also quickly prepared high-quality business reports and created presentations aimed at clients’ upper management outlining the incremental revenue/profit and return on investment for their properties.

This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).

You mastered the Tangam analytics and visualization software and independently constructed valuable customer-facing presentations.

You met with a couple of new clients in-person to assist with their data analytics needs and supported the rollout of Tangam's software. You also quickly prepared high-quality business reports and created presentations aimed at clients’ upper management outlining the incremental revenue/profit and return on investment for their properties.
Based on client feedback and guidance from the Business team, you identified case study opportunities and used client data to demonstrate the benefits of Tangam’s software. These case studies were then released to the press and resulted in new sales.
You went beyond expectations and advanced your knowledge of analytics, operations optimization and data visualization. You shared your knowledge with the business analyst team, thus catalyzing process/technology changes that helped them be more effective in their careers.

The Eastern Townships, located at the very south of the province, shares a border with the United States over close to 300 km (186 mi). The charm comes on thick as you forge your way into this paradise of mountains, hills and valleys. The architectural heritage, evidence of the Anglo-Saxon legacy, has transformed the towns into the most picturesque of places. 80% of the territory is covered by forests. Come the fall season, an abundance of colour covers the branches. To the sheer delight of outdoor enthusiasts, four national parks, including Parc national du Mont-Orford, and many other natural areas provide their share of activities, no matter the season: hiking, biking, camping, skiing and so much more. A favourite vacation destination, the Eastern Townships offers a good selection of B&Bs and inns, not to mention spas and health centres. Agritourism completes the region’s circle of charm, with five different circuits exploring vineyards, orchards, country-style dining, terroir delights and sugar shacks.

Who we are

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo builds the best on-demand transit systems in the world. Fleet operators and public transit agencies in North America and Asia use RideCo’s cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with public buses and switched to driving a car? What about being stuck in traffic while commuting to work solo-driving your car? Have you seen buses drive around in residential areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You’re likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This ‘dynamic shuttle’ (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo’s ‘dynamic shuttle’ platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

Our clients include some of the world's largest fleet operators such as Grab and Los Angeles Metro. RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases today including residential/suburban travel, first-mile-last-mile for train stations, long-distance commuters, university campus, military base, corporate employee transport, and international airport. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

We’ve got data in multiple spots - e-commerce platforms; web analytics platforms; order management systems; customer survey platforms and more; but we haven’t tied them together.
Our business teams have made great efforts to gather, cleanse and organize this data in order to gain insights into how our customers are using our products. Naturally this doesn’t scale.

956,"Analyst, Global Transfer Pricing",KPMG,"Vancouver, BC",5 days ago,"Vancouver, BCPosition Summary:
Transfer pricing is a key component of International Tax. It is estimated that over 60 percent of all world trade takes place between members of multinational groups. Transfer pricing rules address the prices charged on transactions undertaken within a multinational group. The transfer prices charged should be representative of arm’s length prices. Tax administrations are concerned that transfer pricing rules can be misapplied so that the result is an allocation of profits within the Group that is not aligned with economic activities that produced the profits, thus potentially minimizing income taxes payable in certain countries.

Most tax authorities have laws, penalties and audit practices that aim to give them their fair share of tax, and taxpayers have noticed increased activity by the tax authorities. A recent survey of multinationals showed that they not only viewed transfer pricing as the most important international tax issue for them, they considered it more important than all other tax issues combined. With market globalization, ongoing expansion of companies worldwide and the tax authorities’ growing knowledge and aggressiveness in these matters, we consider transfer pricing to be the most significant and difficult tax issue for our clients.

Assisting our clients to undertake and document tax-compliant pricing for intercompany transactions.
Writing reports and other related deliverables that involve documenting and analyzing clients' transfer pricing policies.
Helping our clients currently undergoing transfer pricing audits by tax administrations.
Assisting with negotiating agreements with multiple tax authorities on behalf of our clients that reduce or even eliminate the risk of audit for past and future tax periods.
Developing and evaluating transfer pricing policies for our clients in respect of their international product sales, services, and intangible property.
Performing risk analysis of companies by reviewing their operations and identifying potential transfer pricing issues.
