At VISO, we’re always searching for ways to innovate.

That’s where you come in

As our new Business Analyst, you’ll be responsible for a range of financial duties: things like reporting, data management, costing and analysis.

A big part of this role involves working with our new ERP software, EPICOR. Here you’ll manage end to end business processes, and identify, define, and analyze business requirements. You’ll also support our software transition by being a resource for EPICOR, and contribute to change and product management.

Business analysis is an integral role in our company, and you’ll learn all about our core operations as you gain experience with us. If you can deliver on and exceed the expectations of this role, there will be plenty of chances to grow into more senior positions and responsibilities.

Along with relevant experience, we’re seeking someone who:

Takes initiative – you have the drive and independence to finish projects and tasks on your own, and know how to meet deadlines.
Loves learning – constant improvement is your motto: you are an innovator who’s always looking for a better way.
Excels in group settings – you’re as good with people as you are with analysis, and can use strong interpersonal skills to collaborate with anyone who can lend a hand.
Thinks creatively – you’re strategic and excel in problem solving. You aren’t afraid to try different approaches, and know how to switch tactics when things aren’t working.

Your potential story, one year from now…We’d like to thank you for your contributions providing business consulting and data analytics services to clients that helped the company achieve a consecutive year of triple digit sales growth, two more industry awards, and record customer satisfaction levels. Here are some of your contributions as a member of our ever-growing business team:

You mastered the Tangam analytics and visualization software and independently constructed valuable customer-facing presentations. You used your superior data analytics skills to create recommendations on how clients can improve their operations. You have enabled clients to optimize their game mix, table spreads, schedules and general operations to increase their profitability by 10% - 15%. You supported several successful timely rollouts of Tangam’s software along with the Account Managers and Applications Engineers.
You statistically analyzed clients’ databases with internal tools to understand their patrons’ behavioural and business volume and product performance patterns. You then shared and discussed insights with the Account Managers, and contributed to recommendations on how to configure Tangam’s software based on these findings.
You met with a couple of new clients in-person to assist with their data analytics needs and supported the rollout of Tangam's software. You also quickly prepared high-quality business reports and created presentations aimed at clients’ upper management outlining the incremental revenue/profit and return on investment for their properties.
Based on client feedback and guidance from the Business team, you identified case study opportunities and used client data to demonstrate the benefits of Tangam’s software. These case studies were then released to the press and resulted in new sales.
You went beyond expectations and advanced your knowledge of analytics, operations optimization and data visualization. You shared your knowledge with the business analyst team, thus catalyzing process/technology changes that helped them be more effective in their careers.
We can’t wait until next year. Now back to today. If you’d like this story to be yours, apply now.

The Eastern Townships, located at the very south of the province, shares a border with the United States over close to 300 km (186 mi). The charm comes on thick as you forge your way into this paradise of mountains, hills and valleys. The architectural heritage, evidence of the Anglo-Saxon legacy, has transformed the towns into the most picturesque of places. 80% of the territory is covered by forests. Come the fall season, an abundance of colour covers the branches. To the sheer delight of outdoor enthusiasts, four national parks, including Parc national du Mont-Orford, and many other natural areas provide their share of activities, no matter the season: hiking, biking, camping, skiing and so much more. A favourite vacation destination, the Eastern Townships offers a good selection of B&Bs and inns, not to mention spas and health centres.

AN EXCEPTIONAL AREA!
The Eastern Townships, located at the very south of the province, shares a border with the United States over close to 300 km (186 mi). The charm comes on thick as you forge your way into this paradise of mountains, hills and valleys. The architectural heritage, evidence of the Anglo-Saxon legacy, has transformed the towns into the most picturesque of places. 80% of the territory is covered by forests. Come the fall season, an abundance of colour covers the branches. To the sheer delight of outdoor enthusiasts, four national parks, including Parc national du Mont-Orford, and many other natural areas provide their share of activities, no matter the season: hiking, biking, camping, skiing and so much more. A favourite vacation destination, the Eastern Townships offers a good selection of B&Bs and inns, not to mention spas and health centres. Agritourism completes the region’s circle of charm, with five different circuits exploring vineyards, orchards, country-style dining, terroir delights and sugar shacks. In fact, the region counts several vineyards, all very different from one another, such as the Vignoble Le Cep d’Argent where you can discover the pleasure of their palatable wine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0

Who we are

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo builds the best on-demand transit systems in the world. Fleet operators and public transit agencies in North America and Asia use RideCo’s cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with public buses and switched to driving a car? What about being stuck in traffic while commuting to work solo-driving your car? Have you seen buses drive around in residential areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You’re likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This ‘dynamic shuttle’ (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo’s ‘dynamic shuttle’ platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

Our clients include some of the world's largest fleet operators such as Grab and Los Angeles Metro. RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases today including residential/suburban travel, first-mile-last-mile for train stations, long-distance commuters, university campus, military base, corporate employee transport, and international airport. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.


Requirements:

Education: Undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics / Statistics / Finance / Management Engineering, or related discipline.
Data wizard: Proficient in Excel and Microsoft Office tools. Experience working with business intelligence or visualization tools such as Tableau / SAS / Cognos. Knowledge of relational databases with the ability to read and write SQL is an asset.
Experience in data modeling/analysis or engineering role(s).
Top notch communicator: Strong written/oral communication and presentation skills. Experience preparing reports for management.
Location: Based in Waterloo, Ontario or willing to relocate.
Willing to travel approximately 15%, as needed.


Compensation

Base salary: $70K - $100K, commensurate with qualifications / experience + performance-based bonus or stock options
